For Installation of the meetup, extract the source code into the www folder. If wamp is installed into the C:/ drive, extract to C:/wamp/www.

What we did was have a folder in the www folder and then created a virtual host for it by following the steps as described on this website: http://ronangelo.com/how-to-create-a-project-or-virtual-host-with-wamp/.

Everything is in localhost, it's just in its own folder.
